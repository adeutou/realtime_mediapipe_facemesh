## About
It is a react application that uses streaming webcam to estimate 468 3D face landmarks in real-time. This solution uses transformation learning to import facemesh which is a pre-formed depth learning library to detect the face using tensorflow.js. The triangulation and the different points of the face are drawn using javascript canvas and this solution can detect multiple faces at a time.
